11. Design a scheduler that uses a  preemptive priority scheduling algorithm based on dynamically changing priority. Larger number for priority indicates higher priority.
Assume that the following processes with arrival time and service time wants to execute (for reference):

ProcessID        	Arrival Time    	Service Time
P1                       	 0                         	 4
P2                       	 1                         	 1
P3                       	 2                         	 2
P4                       	 3                         	 1
